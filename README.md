#What is 01 knapsack problem?

The knapsack problem is a well-known problem in computer science.
 Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, and a knapsack with a maximum capacity,
the problem is to determine the maximum value of items that can be put into
 the knapsack without exceeding its capacity.

 In the codes in this repos, i solved the problem with C++ dynamic 
 programming (algorithmic problem is first broken down into sub-problems, 
 the results are saved, and then the sub-problems are optimized to find the overall solution).
